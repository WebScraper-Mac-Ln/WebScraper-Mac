 ## Overview
 
 ### Enhanced Workflow for macOS
WebScraper is implemented as an adaptable web data extraction and scraping tool with attention to macOS-native workflows and predictable performance. The interface groups essential controls in a way that reduces friction during repeated tasks, keeping navigation consistent whether the user is working with quick interactions or longer, focused sessions. Internal routines follow a local processing model, ensuring that core operations stay available even when the system is offline or under network constraints.

### Optimized for macOS-Native Workflows
By aligning tightly with macOS interface conventions, WebScraper integrates cleanly into the broader desktop environment. It respects standard behaviors for windows, menus and keyboard shortcuts, and interacts smoothly with Finder dialogs, file pickers and notifications. This makes it straightforward to combine the app with other tools in the stack, whether the workflow involves web scraping and data extraction, communication, or structured project work.

### Localized Resource Handling & Customization
The internal engine is structured around configurable profile settings so that users can adapt WebScraper to their own environment. Options may include how accounts are managed, how histories are retained, how projects are indexed, how logs are stored or how frequently state is refreshed. Because processing runs locally, these customizations remain reliable in controlled networks, studio spaces and secure offices where external dependencies are limited or unavailable.

### Cross-Hardware Optimization
WebScraper is tuned to run effectively on both Intel and Apple Silicon based Macs, balancing CPU and memory usage to keep the interface responsive while heavier tasks run in the background. Long operations such as indexing, synchronization, analysis passes or large project refresh cycles are managed by internal task schedulers, so that pointer movement, scrolling and window updates remain smooth even under load.
